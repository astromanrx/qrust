## QRust (Under Development)
The idea is to have a small code editor that uses all the screen, no menu, no toolbar , no nothing. Right now it's focused on Rust , I'll add Aptos Move after this.

Features: 
- [ ] Edit text
- [ ] Command mode
- [ ] Save and Load
- [ ] Auto save

- [ ] Aptos Move compiler integration
- [ ] Git integration
